description: Carries out development in the specified project according to its specification
---

You are going to work to the `specification` under the $ARGUMENTS project. Identify the outstanding work by the 🟦 marker, and choose whichever such feature seems the most appropriate next step.

Having chosen a feature to implement, you should read around related areas of the spec to make sure you understand the context.

Implement that feature, and when it is complete, update its entry in the specification to have the ✅ marker, and commit all changes to this git repository with a short, snappy description of the feature.

If you think a feature is very elaborate and you want to tackle it in stages, consider expanding the specification to describe those stages, giving them their own 🟦 markers so you can update them individually to the ✅ marker as you implement and git-commit each separate aspect of the parent feature.

**IMPORTANT**: If there is no remaining work to implement, output the following exact string, and quit:

NO_REMAINING_WORK
